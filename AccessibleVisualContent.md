When presenting results and concepts make sure you make your graphics and visual assetts accessible. It is an issue of social justice, as you do not want to cut out any members of your audience due to physical deficiencies or impairments, and it is beneficial to you to be able to communicate your message to the wudest audience possible. 

# The choice of color and fonts will affect the perception and accessibility of the information you are sharing. 


# Color blindness

Colour (color) blindness (colour vision deficiency, or CVD) refers to conditions that modify the perception of color; it affects approximately 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women in the world. 

1) choose color-blind compliant palettes when making plots.

Many coding languages have graphic packages that offer color-blind compliant color palettes, 

- R: http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/#a-colorblind-friendly-palette

- Python: while the default colors in [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) v.3 he are perceptually homogeneous and well designed, they are not generally colorblind friendly. 
There is [the intent](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/9460) to move to a colorblind-friendly palette. In the meantime, the [seaborn package offers a color-blind palette](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html#qualitative-color-palettes).

2) Download apps to simulate different types of color blindness to assure your graphics and slides are readable for all people, siuch as the [colororacle](http://colororacle.org/)

3) choose color-blind compliant palettes when designing slides. 

# Make sure that your slides are readable to dyslexic and vision impaired members of the audience, and overall clear and accessible

Follow [these recommandations](https://www.ifla.org/files/assets/hq/officers/documents/wbu-visual-presentations-guidelines-summary.pdf) from the World Blind Union about fonts, font size, color, brightness, and contrast choices.
