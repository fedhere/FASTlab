How to ask a coding question. 
==================================

We (me and your TA's) are in the business of helping you learn. 
Literally that is what we get a paycheck for. Thus we do welcome your questions! 
However, and especially considering there are about 100 of you, please try to help us managing the workload by asking computational questions the right way, and by making some efforts to find a solution on your own before you come to us. 
Turns out this workflow, which minimizes our effort, also maximizes your learning. 

If you come across an error message, in bash, Python, or in whichever software or language you are 
working, the first thing to do is to actually **read the error**. I know there is a small sense of panic and defeat when you get an error, which makes you want to throw the towel, and reach for assistance, but error messages are your friends! you should go beyond the word 'error' or the word 'fatal' and try and understand 
what the software is complaining about. Many pieces of software will offer details about the error, try to identify the culprit, and propose solutions to you. Git for example always gives you suggestions on what to do to address an error. 

The next thing is **reread the error, every time!** Even though you still have an error after changing things up you should not assume that 
it is the same error. Your code, just like mine, just like anyone's, is blooming with bugs like a warm summer night 
in NYC. Even when it works, and even when it gives the correct answer, it's still buggy, you can bet money on it! It is the course of the coder. As you solve one issue 
others may come up. Read the error message every time - it may be different than the first one. Sometimes the end of the error is the same ('fatal error, i refuse to do whatever you tell me to do') but the body refers to a completely different issue. If you tell us the 
solution we suggested had no effect, we will go look into the problem and try and figure out another solution. If
it turns out in fact we had solved the problem days ago, and something else entirely was also wrong, that is a waste of our and your time. 

Also, look around! Look on the *NYU classes* resources, announcements, board, to see if the problem is solved there
by your classmates. Google it, and look on http://stackoverflow.com/. By all means, if you find solutions that are not clear to you, 
or you do not a find solution, come to us. But try to solve the problem yourself first, because I assure you will learn more that way. 

Lastly: give us all the information we need to help you. That is a tough one: it takes some time and experience to figure out what the person on our end needs to know about your error to be able to understand it. While coding you get obviously very, very intimate with your code... it is easy to lose sight of the fact that on the other end we know little to nothing about it!
If you have an error on your terminal, tell us, by copy and paste 
and/or w a screenshot, what **the command** that causes the error is, 
and what **the full error** is. If it is code you are running, 
make sure we have access to the code to inspect it. Tell us which platform you are working on, 
Linux, Mac, Windows (git bash or something else...). 
Otherwise it's gonna be garbage in -> garbage out. 
I recommand you look on http://stackoverflow.com/ to get a sense of how people 
write questions the proper way, and by all means not everyone does. Look at the replies and see 
if the users that are trying to answer need a lot of additional material, or if they are complaining about the format of the question. 

In summary, help us help you! 

Have a great day!
