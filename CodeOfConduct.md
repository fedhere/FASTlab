# Federica's Research Group Code of Conduct

**Diversity is a resource that enriches us culturally and intellectually. Thank you for making this space harassment free and inclusive to all members of the group and outside colleagues**. If you have concerns, if you do not feel safe or are made to feel unwelcome in this research environment, please come talk to me. If you feel targeted, come talk to me. If you see instances of ill-natured interactions please come talk to me (keeping in mind that I am a mandatory reporter according to [Title IX](https://sites.udel.edu/sexualmisconduct/how-to-report/guidelines-for-reporting/) and [here](TitleIX.md)). There are many additional resources at UDel if you wish to employ independent reporting channels; please see [this list of resources](UDelResources.md). 

The following Code of Conduct applies to all interactions of members of my research group, online and offline, including social media, mailing lists, forums, meetings, conferences, and one-to-one interactions.

- All members of the group should be treated with respect regardless of personal attributes, including but not limited to: race, ethniticity, gender or gender identity, physical appearence, phyiscal abilities, religious believes, political affiliation or opinions, sexual preference, caregiver status, age, nationality, language.

- Harrasment, verbal or physical, are not tollerated. Keep in mind that what is acceptable to one person may not be acceptable to another. 

- Bullying, including physical bullying, exclusion, marginalization, disparagement, or intimidation, is not tolerated.

- All members of the group are empowered to request that an undesirable behavior is dismissed. 

- All members are expected to immediately stop any behavior inconsistent with the Code of Conduct regardless of original intent.

This Code of Conduct supplements, and does not overwrite, the Codes of Conduct that you are bind to in your role at UDel. For example [here is the UDel students' CoC](http://www1.udel.edu/stuguide/18-19/code.html)


## Group Interactions and meeting conduct:
I expect to see a supportive, collaborative attitude from all of my collaborators to assure we maintain and foster a learning environment that leads to rigor, excellence, and happiness. This includes: 


- be mindful of cultural norms. Make sure you know how your teammates want to be addressed (e.g. ask their preferred pronoun; mine is she/her/hers). Do not interrupt your teammates while they are speaking, do not speak over teammates and be aware and respectful of the natural volume of their voice. Be respectful of individual communication skills and fluency in the common languages we speak. 

- be available, within reason, to share knowledge and do so respectfully. Never make a teammate feel bad for not knowing something you already know. It is not your role to assess your teammates' efforts or knowledge. If you feel like supporting a teammate is getting in the way of your productivity in the group bring this concern to me directly.

- be conscientious and value your teammates time when asking for help. Make sure you have done your share of weight lifting: you have reviewed the resources available to the group and looked around for answers when applicable. Prepare yourself to receive help: be prepared to ask clear questions and to be able to show and demonstrate the issues you are having. Your teammates should not be struggling to understand what your problem is (this includes having access to the computers where you are running your codes if the question is technical/computational, and being able to reproduce errors and behaviors for which you seek help).

- do not use your phone or laptop in meetings if not to take notes or find resources to contribute to the conversation. This is out of respect for your teammates: if they are speaking they should be heard! 

- be on time for meetings, with me and any other teammates (and anyone else). I am admittedly terrible at that. But my poor example should not be an excuse for you to be late and it is important *for you* to maximize your time with me and with your teammates, in addition to being a demonstration of respect toward the team. 

Here is an excellent example of [social rules that foster collaborative environments from the *Recourse Center*](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules).

Every day I try to remind myself of all these norms, but I do too fail to respect them at times. If you notice that I have not followed any of these rules, or you think I am adopting behaviors that make you uncomfortable please promptly let me know!
Please find and carefully review all resources I made available to the group here https://github.com/fedhere/FBBTeamResources . The preferred way to receive suggestions about these documents is via isses and pull requests in this repo. Thank you!
