# Files for PHYS 838 notebook assignment on SN cosmology 

Slides file https://github.com/fedhere/FASTlab/blob/master/PHYS838SNcosmo/sn_phys838-compressed.pdf

Notebook with missing cells of code to fill in - figure out what to minimize, how to minimize it, and what is being plotted. Look for where it says "replace with your code"

Notebook fully solved. Just enjoy clicking through it and seeing the results popping up
