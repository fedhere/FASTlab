### 3 Results (required)

This section should be a discussion of what you did, how you did it, why you did it, and what you found.  For example,

_In order to explore the extent to which dimensionality reduction plus a classifier can be used to tag each spectrum with a known spectral type, I wrote pca_classify.py (link to code) which first whitened the spectra and then used scikit-learnâ€™s PCA functionality to decompose the sample into N=20 principle components.  The first 5 are shown in Figure 1.  The figure shows that these components are dominated by only a few spectral lines.  Figure 2 shows the explained variance as a function of the number of included principle components and suggests that N=20 is insufficient.  Nevertheless, by projecting onto these components and training an SVM classifier (using grid search on the parameters Cand ; see Figure 3) with training and testing sets of size 3,500 and 1,500 respectively, I achieved an accuracy of 80% on the testing set._

### 4 Planning (required)

List the tasks that you will perform next week. For example:
_perform PCA on power spectra sample, investigate the PCA components and identify the one(s) that could be associated to instrumental signal._

In this section it would be inapprioriate, following the example above, to continue describing the tasks as in:
_then perform reconstruction of power spectra without that component and recreate the original time series witouth the instrumental signal_ 
**unless** you have some resonable confidence that you will be able to perform all 4 tasks. In other words, from week to week you are responsible for performing the tasks you propose to perform, or report on roadblocks that prevented their execution.
